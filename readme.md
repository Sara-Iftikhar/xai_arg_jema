# Paper title and data availability
This is the code for the paper "Prediction and interpretation of 
antibiotic-resistance genes occurrence at recreational beaches using machine
learning models"  authored by Sara Iftikhar, Asad Mustafa Karim, 
Aoun Murtaza Karim, Mujahid Aizaz Karim, Muhammad Aslam, Fazila Rubab, 
Sumera Kausar Malik, Jeong Eun Kwon, Imran Hussain, Esam I. Azhar, 
Se Chan Kang and  Muhammad Yasir. Folder "data" in "scripts" folder 
contains the  Pakistan data used in this study to build this model in 
addition with Busan data which can be found on 
https://github.com/AtrCheema/ai4water-datasets.

# Files in this Repository 
Fully reproducible code is available in "scripts" folder, which further
contains folder for each ARG considered in this study. For 
"aac_coppml(6â€²-Ib-cr)", the folder named "aac" contains files for 
cross validation and interpretation methods. File named 
"aac_cross_validation.py" was used to apply 10-Fold timeseries 
cross validation. Files "ale_results.py", "lime_results.py", 
"pdp_results.py", "permutation_results.py", "sensitivity_results.py",
and "shap_results.py" were used to generate results for 
Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), Local Interpretable Model
90 Explanations (LIME), Partial Dependance PLots (PDP),
Permutation Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis and 
Shaply Additive exPlanations (SHAP) respectively.

The codes and other relevent files for "sul1_coppml" and 
 "tetx_coppml" are available in their respective folders.
